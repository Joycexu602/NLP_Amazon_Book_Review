In this project, we will deploy NLP techniques on 3,000,000 rows review text from Amazon book dataset.

We will conduct data cleaning on 3,000,000 rows review text.

Additionally, we will integrate NLP techniques with the colloborative filtering method to generate the personalized book list for each target reader. The customized book list would be more attractive to target reader than the ordinary high-ranking book list.
